					Automated Blinds
					</p>
					<p class="articleBody">
					Another home automation project... really? <br>
					Well, yes. They're useful AND, I already live in a perfectly-calibrated testing environment - a normal house. <br>

					The blinds were originally standard, off-the-shelf, cordless blinds that I modified to allow for control from my phone.
					Out of the box, the blinds did use 4 gears to synchronize the raising/lowering of the two sides and a spring that prevents gravity from pulling the blinds to the floor.<br>
					However, the unmodified blinds had to be raised/lowered by hand, so inconvenient!
					<br><br>
					I machined away some of the housing plastic so I could engage with one of the internal gears.
					A brushed DC motor is mounted to the blinds top-base using custom 3D-printed plastic.
					The gear attached to the rotor is also 3D printed and was designed using the gears in the original blinds as a model.
					To keep track of the position of the blinds, the Arduino uses a limit switch mounted to the top-base to recalibrate its home position every time the blinds are fully raised.
					<br> <br>
					I used an Arduino 101 to communicate with an Android App via Bluetooth, generate the driving PWM for the brushed DC motor, and keep track of the position of the blinds.
					As can be seen in the first video, my Android app now controls both the Automated Blinds and my previous project, the Remote Lightswitch.
					<br> <br>
					
					3D modeling of the gear, motor holder, and assembly was again made easy by 
					<a href="https://www.onshape.com/" 
					target="_self" rel="help">Onshape</a> web-based and free 3D modeling software.

					Remote Lightswitch
					</p>
					<p class="articleBody">
					Last year, I set out to make something I would actually use regularly and decided on a Remote Lightswitch. <br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<video class="center" width="640" height="360" controls>
					<source src="./vid/RemoteLightSwitch.mp4" type="video/mp4">

					<br>
					A custom piece of 3D-printed plastic holds a servo motor at a distance from the switch such that the servo horn can knock the switch on the way up and down.
					On the back side of the plastic is an Arduino 101, which controls the motor and deals with wireless communication.
					Unlike a relay switch embedded in the lightswitch itself, this module has the advantage of still allowing mechanical control of the switch at all times.
					The switch is controlled via Bluetooth from a custom Android app.
					There is a USB connection for the Arduino, but only for providing power.<br> <br>
					
					This project had the added benefit of allowing me to try 
					<a href="https://www.onshape.com/" 
					target="_self" rel="help">Onshape</a> 
					3D modeling.  I have a friend at Onshape who had been applying soft pressure on me for months to give it a go.  Now I can see why; it's free to start, web based, and much more intuitive than Sketchup.
					<br><br>
					
					I finished this project some months ago and still use it regularly.
					I usually find myself reaching for this phone app a few minutes after turning the light off, when I realize I'd really rather put off sleeping in favor of catching up on an edX course.

					Coming Online!
					</p>
					<p class="articleBody">
					I created this website after seeing a series of advertisements for pre-made site designs.
					Seeing the ads made me wonder if years of updates to the HTML language had simplified website design since my high-school encounter with HTML.
					<br><br/>
					The answer seems to be an emphatic yes.
					After a few nights of learning and coding, I have a simple site design I'm happy to put my name on, literally.
					I decided to make the site live so I can keep working on it.  
					I think it will be fun to build an online repository of my personal projects, which I'll be posting soon!
