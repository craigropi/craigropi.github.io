					About Me
				</p>
				<p class="articleBody">
					I'm currently working as an Electrical Engineer at Amazon Robotics, on the mobile robotics design team.
					Outside of electronics, I enjoy following space exploration, learning about microbiology and macroeconomics, traveling, tennis, hiking, snowboarding, and playing music with friends.
				</p>
				<p class="articleBody">
					Before working with Amazon to help design their robotic fleet, I was part of a small 7-employee comapany, Ferro Solutions.  
					At Ferro I designed near-field through-earth communication and wireless-power systems using their proprietary magnetostrictive-piezoelectric receivers.
					Prior to joining Ferro Solutions, I spent some time at General Dynamics C4 Systems working with hardware encryption products.
				</p>
				
				<p class="articleBody">
					I graduated from Worcester Polytechnic Institute with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a minor in Computer Science.
					Throughout my career, I've taken courses spanning a wide range of topics though the online learning platform Edx, including a Robotics Micromasters program produced by UPenn.
					I strive to be a lifelong learner and constantly seek out professional or personal projects that will help me expand my technical toolbox and see the bigger picture when working on a problem.
					Most of all, I love to design products that are useful and inspiring!
